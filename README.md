## About the project
Based on the framework provided by Javier Agenjo, teacher of the UPF, for the class of Electronic Games.<br/>
The objetive of this class was to develop our own 2D game engine, with software rendering, for a small game of our creation, in just a week's time.<br/>

## Dependecies
- Javier Agenjo's framework, that wraps arorund SDL2 and some of OpenGL's functionality.
- SDL2.
- Bass Sound library. (Note: i could not get it to work due to time constraints).
- Tweeny, for interpolation and animation (but the functionality was scrapped in the last versions).

## The Game
This assigment was for us to acomodate to the basic framework and some basic game engine development, in just a week, with the theme "Together".<br/>
This is a platform game in wich your aura makes NPCs follow you arround, each one with different characteristics, and you have to make it to the finish line with as much people as you can.<br/>
Since there is no hardware based rendering, the performance is not quite good, especially in a game with this resolution.<br/>
Also, it was my first time working with collsiion detection and resolution, and even thought I think it came out pretty nice, there are some adge cases that messes up the whole system.<br/>

## The Future
I am right now working on a remake of this project, with a new game engine, with hardware acceleration, and lots of new features!<br/>
